Solar Battery Charger with MPPT
This project involved designing and simulating a solar-powered battery charger using an Interleaved Buck-Boost Converter and a Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithm. Implemented the Perturb & Observe (P&O) method in PSIM to dynamically optimize energy extraction from a photovoltaic panel and efficiently regulate charging of a 100V battery. I collaborated on the algorithm design, control system integration, and overall simulation, achieving over 95% MPPT efficiency under varying irradiance conditions.

Wind Turbine System with MPPT
Built and simulated a wind energy conversion system using a 3-phase Permanent Magnet Generator, an Interleaved Buck-Boost Converter, and a custom MPPT controller. Developed a real-time P&O-based MPPT algorithm to adjust generator shaft speed dynamically and maximize power output across changing wind conditions (8â€“16 m/s). Included full speed control, current regulation, and wind modeling. Simulations demonstrated robust performance with low overshoot and settling times.
